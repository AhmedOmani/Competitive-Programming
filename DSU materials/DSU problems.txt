Solution:
	The idea that you have the space of using swaping indecies as you want , so you collect all related indecies that you can go through like
	[0,2][1,2] => that means that you can swap as many as you can between 0,1,2 and they become one component 
        so we use DSU to collect indecies in the same component and then greedly we put maximum numbers in even indecies and minimum numbers in odd indecies
        by that way it is the 100% your best to maximize the final answer
